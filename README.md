# Library

A small and simple project for adding and removing Book objects.

Things Learned:

1. A refresher on JS Objects.
2. Using Object.create to create a copy of object and inherit from prototype. 
3. Not sure if Object.create replaces using 'new ObjectConstructorName'.
4. No localstorage or login added, will add this functionality later.
